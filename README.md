This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## About

**funny-test** is a playful Vue 3 project featuring two amusing components:

- **SliderView**: Select a value using a slider and watch as a quirky formula transforms your choice into a "weird" final value. It's a fun way to see how numbers can behave unexpectedly!
- **CheckboxView**: Try to select a checkbox, and more options keep appearing, making it a challenge to pick just one. This component is designed to surprise and entertain users with its ever-growing list.

The project is a lighthearted demonstration of interactive UI elements and creative logic, perfect for learning and having fun with Vue 3.
